"""Build deployable Christopher runtime slots from the recovered June baseline.

The June baseline files stay byte-exact (provenance-pinned). Every slot is
baseline + the authored patch layer:

  - processing gate forced closed (pa.enabled false, whatsapp gateway off)
  - memory hard-off (memory_enabled / user_profile_enabled false) — WB b63dd4f0
  - ops-judgment operations (clarification / attention / WC attach) —
    patches/ops-judgment-operations.snippet.yaml
  - ops-ingest judgment rules + structured work_items extraction —
    patches/ops-ingest-judgment.snippet.yaml
  - management-chat behavior (register, grounded answers, proactive attention
    push, write authority + three-flow, provenance, hold-framing, refusals) —
    patches/mgmt-chat-behavior.snippet.yaml
  - management-chat business-operation scope (full case-shaped registry;
    config/routing/purge asks refused by registry absence) —
    patches/mgmt-business-operations.snippet.yaml
  - per-slot engine: model + optional agent.reasoning_effort

Slots are keyed by slot id, not bare model name: gpt-5.6-luna-low runs
gpt-5.6-luna at reasoning_effort low.

# Chat-scoped inbound allowlist (2026-07-20, teren-ratified; WB 0cd5698b).
# STAGED, NOT ACTIVATED: this only NARROWS which chats inbound processing would
# ever consider. Processing itself stays shut by pa.enabled=false +
# platforms.whatsapp.enabled=false + the runtime processing gate; none of those
# are touched here. The gate this feeds — whatsapp.py _is_group_allowed, called
# from _should_process_message as the FIRST statement of _build_message_event —
# can only return False for more chats than before, never True for more.
# Under `open` every group passes; under `allowlist` only this JID passes.
#
# The JID is rung 3a's authorized group, matching the deployed independent
# verifier table (VERIFIED_RUNG_JIDS['3a'] in
# /opt/tgg-capture/whatsapp-bridge/rung-authority.js), so staged inbound scope
# and outbound scope name the SAME chat.
#
# Both blocks must carry the keys. The top-level `whatsapp:` block is bridged
# into platforms.whatsapp.extra and WINS (gateway/config.py: `extra.update(bridged)`),
# and `_group_allow_from` reads config.extra with NO env fallback — so setting
# only one block would leave the allowlist empty and block every group.
#

# bridge's own store (capture history-metadata.jsonl group names cross-checked
# against tgg-chat-map.md). INCLUDED: the four maintenance site/zone work
# groups + the rung-3a mgmt live-test group + the PcL-internal deployment-
# verification group ("Boss of Christopher" — NOT a client maintenance group;
# included deliberately, coordinator-approved 2026-07-21, so the stock
