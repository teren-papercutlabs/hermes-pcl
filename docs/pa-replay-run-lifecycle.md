# PA replay run lifecycle

`hermes replay-run` is the PA replay orchestrator of record. It owns the run state around the native Hermes replay primitive and the systems-pcl replay target provider.

Boundary:

- Hermes `replay` executes normal gateway turns under `agent:replay:<run-id>`.
- `hermes replay-run` mints the run id, persists the run manifest, enforces the mechanical verify gate, and is the only Hermes-side path that calls provider promote/rollback.
- The target provider owns target preparation, run-id write guards, provider-specific invariants, promote, and rollback.

## State machine

```text
initialized
  -> preparing_target
  -> prepared
  -> running_agent_replay
  -> replayed
  -> verifying
  -> verified
  -> promoting
  -> promoted
  -> rolling_back
  -> rolled_back
```

Failure/abandon paths move to `dirty` or `failed`. Dirty runs are terminal and cannot promote. A promoted run may still roll back through the provider promotion manifest.

## Start a replay run

The start command performs `prepare_target -> run_agent_replay -> verify` and stops before promote.

```bash
export PS_REPLAY_PROVIDER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5192"
export PS_REPLAY_PROVIDER_ADMIN_TOKEN="..."

hermes replay-run start \
  --tenant tgg \
  --agent-id christopher \
  --job-type replay \
  --provider-url "$PS_REPLAY_PROVIDER_URL" \
  --provider-admin-token "$PS_REPLAY_PROVIDER_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  --source-data-dir /path/to/source-ps-data \
  --target-data-dir /path/to/fresh-eval-ps-data \
  --target-base-url http://127.0.0.1:5192 \
  --plan /path/to/replay-plan.json \
  --out-dir /path/to/replay-runs \
  --tool-error-budget 0
```

For a `bridge_message_log` corpus, `tenant`, `agent_id`, and `job_type` are
required replay-context fields. They may be supplied by the command line as
shown above or explicitly in that corpus source block. Existing persisted
plans that omit them are rejected rather than inferred. Because these fields
are part of the canonical source manifest, a plan created before this contract
change has a different digest; finish or abandon an in-flight run with its
original code version rather than mixing versions.

The command writes:

- `run-manifest.json` — state machine, target descriptor/baseline digests, attempt digests, gate result.
- `target-prepare.json` — provider prepare result without token literals.
- `replay-plan.json` — the exact `ReplayPlan` handed to Hermes.
- `attempt-<attempt-id>.json` — replay result + attempt provenance.
- `verify-report.json` — mechanical gate checks.

## Mechanical verify gate

Promote is refused unless all checks pass:

- corpus parity: processed message count equals the deterministic corpus count.
- processed-turn coverage: PA turn records exist and cover source message ids.
- zero failed PA turns.
- zero escaped outbound sends: captured replay outbounds
  (`delivery_mode=capture`) are reported for review but do not fail the gate;
  any non-capture outbound remains a hard-fail capture-lock leak.
- tool-error budget not exceeded.
- provider descriptor/baseline digests match their manifests.
- attempt/code/replay-policy digests match persisted manifests.
- provider invariants pass through `POST /api/operator/replay-target/verify`.

Re-run the gate:

```bash
hermes replay-run verify \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json \
  --session-db ~/.hermes/state.db \
  --tool-error-budget 0
```

A failed verify marks the target dirty locally and through the provider dirty endpoint. Dirty targets cannot promote; rebuild from a fresh baseline and rerun.

## Promote / rollback

Promotion must be called through the orchestrator manifest. Do not call the provider promote endpoint directly.

For this phase, use only non-prod target directories. Real TGG production promote is held for the gated validation phase.
The confirmation token is tenant-derived:
`ORCHESTRATOR_<NORMALIZED_TENANT>_TARGET` (for example,
`ORCHESTRATOR_TGG_TARGET`).

```bash
hermes replay-run promote \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json \
  --prod-data-dir /path/to/non-prod-prod-dir \
  --confirm ORCHESTRATOR_TGG_TARGET
```

Rollback uses the provider promotion manifest recorded in `run-manifest.json`:

```bash
hermes replay-run rollback \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json
```

If the provider manifest path must be supplied manually:

```bash
hermes replay-run rollback \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json \
  --promotion-manifest-path /path/to/provider/promotions/<promotion>.json
```

## Recovery commands

Inspect current state:

```bash
hermes replay-run status \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json
```

Mark an abandoned or suspect run dirty:

```bash
hermes replay-run dirty \
  --tenant tgg \
  --manifest /path/to/replay-runs/<run-id>/run-manifest.json \
  --reason "abandoned after partial replay"
```

Fresh-baseline-only rule: never promote an in-place resumed target. If a run dies after target preparation or replay starts, mark it dirty, prepare a new target data dir, and rerun from the original corpus/plan.
